//consider the object
var example = {
    name: 'rohan',
    age: 10
};
// now how to annotate is giving annotation to each property of the object
var example2 = {
    name: 'Rohan',
    age: 24
};
//you can give the annotation to some of the properties without declaring or assigning them in the object
var example3 = {
    name: 'Ramesh',
    age: 65
};
